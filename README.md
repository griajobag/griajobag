Flutter, Kotlin and Java for Android are my proffesional skills that i use to find a Job or Project in corporate level. But currently Flutter is my primary skill, I'm very confidence with Flutter.
 

:information_source: Beside the mobile development skills side, I also know about <b>Laravel</b> and <b>MySQL</b>. Those technologies I used for develop a simple CRUD REST-API and ADMIN-PAGE 

:warning: <b>Laravel</b> and <b>MySQL</b> IS NOT my primary skills. I never take a Corporate Level Project using those skills. I just take a small project or bussiness that no advance feature contains on the application :warning: <br>
